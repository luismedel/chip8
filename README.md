A very simple Chip-8 emulator and debugger, result of two afternoons of work. The emulator seems to work ok with the roms I've played with and I don't plan to add support for high resolution modes nor super/megachip extensions.

### About Chip-8 ###

(from [http://spritesmods.com/?art=chip8console&page=1](http://spritesmods.com/?art=chip8console&page=1))

In the 80s, some manufacturers of home-computer wanted to create a game-platform that'd make it easy to run games on and that would be compatible between several types of home-computers. They basically invented a virtual processor designed for games: the chip8. The computers the chip8 was emulated on, weren't that capable: a few K of memory and composite b/w output were all they had. Still, some fun games were written for the platform.

### Obtaining roms ###

Download a pack of roms with games and demos from [http://chip8.com/?page=109](http://chip8.com/?page=109)

### Wait...a WinForms application? ###

Why not? For such a simple project I wanted the simplest of graphical outputs.
